# AP_Computer_Science
These projects were created in my high school AP Computer Science class. I worked with a partner to create these two applications. 

#IMPORTANT!!
Our teacher created a template to help us make our applications functional. I do not own those template files and thus have omitted them from this repository. I have only included code my partner and I wrote. However as a result, these apps will not run on their own.
